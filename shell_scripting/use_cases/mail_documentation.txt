SENDING MAIL FROM THE COMMAND LINE AND ALSO AUTOMATING IT IN A SCRIPT

There are differnt command in sending mail in linux, some which are;
ssmtp
mail
mailx
mutt e.t.c.

But there is a little configuration that needs to be done on 2 particular files, which are /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf and /etc/ssmtp/revaliases.

on the /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf file, you put this configuration data;

#
# Config file for sSMTP sendmail
#
# The person who gets all mail for userids < 1000
# Make this empty to disable rewriting.
root=oriafodevops@gmail.com

# The place where the mail goes. The actual machine name is required no
# MX records are consulted. Commonly mailhosts are named mail.domain.com
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:465

# Where will the mail seem to come from?
rewriteDomain=gmail.com

# The full hostname
hostname=dikodin-HP-EliteBook-840-G2

# Are users allowed to set their own From: address?
# YES - Allow the user to specify their own From: address
# NO - Use the system generated From: address
FromLineOverride=YEs

UseTLS=YES
#UseSTARTTLS=YES
AuthUser=oriafodevops@gmail.com
AuthPass=rojmmmczmbobnxox
AuthMethod=LOGIN
#TLS_CA_File=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

Then on the /etc/ssmtp/revaliases file, you put this configuration data;
# sSMTP aliases
#
# Format:       local_account:outgoing_address:mailhub
#
# Example: root:your_login@your.domain:mailhub.your.domain[:port]
# where [:port] is an optional port number that defaults to 25.

root:oriafodevops@gmail.com:smtp.gmail.com:465

while our script look this way;
#!/bin/bash

#This script check for subnet that is up and send email to a specified mail showing the subnet that are down.

sending_mail(){
for i in $@
do
echo $i
        ping -c 1 $i &> /dev/null
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]
        then
                        echo "testing message" | mail -s "Status report for $i hostname" abrahamibharunujele@gmail.com <<< "Could not reach $i hostname, because hostname is down" -A /home/dikodin/Documents/Devops/shell_scripting/use_cases/mail_documentation.txt
        fi
done
}

#This message body is being sent into an unnamed file and sent along as an attachment intead of it appearing in the message body. along side the attached document. i will fix that later.
